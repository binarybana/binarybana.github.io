Breadcrumb for myself: Remember, you already setup Github Actions CI to build on push, so just commit!

Another breadcrumb: I made it even easier for you to start writing, just run

```
mise new "Wonderful but optional title"
```
And you'll have a new post stub in `content/blog` ready for editing!

Now trying to migrate away from Github pages.
