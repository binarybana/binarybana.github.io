I'm converting my blog from [blogger.com](www.blogger.com) to using an 
excellent little static site generator called [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).  

Fortunately the process was not too painful with Google's (much appreciated) 
support for exporting my entire blog as a single XML dump and the handy 
[blogger2jekyll](https://github.com/coolaj86/blogger2jekyll) tool for 
converting this XML blob into a bunch of markdown files with YAML front 
matters.

While I'm finalizing this some of the styling may be broken on the posts and 
the comments are currently down. But hang tight!
