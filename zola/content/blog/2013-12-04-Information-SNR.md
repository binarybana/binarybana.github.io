<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
I've noticed that when I read the scientific literature, I often get discouraged. "None of my ideas are new," and any that are new are probably not very good compared to what is out there.<br /><br />This effect of information input stimying creativity and productive output makes me wonder, rather than changing my information input to more 'productive' sources (books over Reddit for instance), perhaps I should reduce it's volume entirely?<br /><br />But what would this look like? What would I do with my time instead of reading and learning about things? I guess this is what is called "tinkering" or piddling around. Just playing with the tools and resources I have available and strictly avoiding outside sources (or at least interleaving periods of isolation).<br /><br />What would happen? This certainly could be an interesting 30 day challenge.<br /><br />I guess this is how writing happens, as it certainly is impossible to write a blog post while browsing Reddit, reading Linux kernel documentation, or learning a programming language.<br /><br />All things in moderation I guess...
