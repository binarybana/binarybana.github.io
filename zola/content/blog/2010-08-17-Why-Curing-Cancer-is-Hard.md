I work in a lab where we try to use modern engineering and mathematics to develop cancer fighting strategies. While&nbsp;working on research today, I decided to take a step back and recall where my bit of work fits in the broader scheme of fighting cancer. This is when I began to realize two things:<br /><ol><li>My work comprises a very, very small piece of the effort needed (not a big surprise really).</li><li>Fighting cancer is really, <i>really </i>hard.&nbsp;</li></ol><div>Let me try and use some analogies to explain. Imagine you are near an out of sight road where you can hear the passing vehicles but not see them.&nbsp;</div>
