<p dir="ltr">One day I was growing frustrated with a problem and I needed to put some thought into it. I had done meditation scheduled for later in the day and I was a little disappointed that I wasn't going to get to think about my problem more. But then I realized that meditation is an important part of solving mental problems in the same way that cleaning your work area is an important part of creating. I allows you to make mental room and energy for three upcoming problem.</p>
