Well hello there! For some reason you've stumbled onto this part of the internet, so I'll do my best to entertain you.

I'm roughly `O(10)` years old, and after building [OctoML](https://octoml.ai), I'm now at NVIDIA trying to make machine learning easier. Check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/binarybana/) for my formal career history. But in short, in the past I've been a computational biologist, data engineer, compiler engineer, product manager, and head of product. Always thinking, meditating, and (for now) increasing in entropy.

Always looking for stimulating conversations and connections, don't be afraid to [reach out](mailto:binarybana+homepage@gmail.com). Or keep going to read some of my random thoughts below.
