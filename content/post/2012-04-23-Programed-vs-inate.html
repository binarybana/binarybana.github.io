<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
We always assume that our kids will find what they love to do, but is it really such in inborn, innate thing? Or is it more a result of imprinting, patterning, and circumstance?<br /><br />Let me give an example: we try to give our kids opportunities to find what they love doing, so we don't push them into any one thing letting them try many activities. And then all the sudden they find that they like chess and want to be a professional chess star. But what really happened here? I would argue two things: 1) they happened to play a few games of rewarding chess (where they won, or were complimented on how they lost gracefully etc) and then being the social creatures that we are - our child all the sudden 'likes' chess because others have told him he is good at it, he feels good at it, and his friends almost expect that out of him. and 2) due to biological variation, he might very well BE better than most people at chess due to neurological differences, but I would argue that these effects are probably nowhere near as strong as 1) and if anything, make 1) even stronger.<br /><br />Now this is a simplistic example, but the main question to ask is: If we accept that finding our passion is a result of our biology AND our surroundings, shouldn't we setup our surroundings in the best possible way to accomodate this? Or are we already doing so by putting our kids in many different activities?<br /><br />Think of the truly great scientists, could we 'create' more of them?
